# OneFish Design System

A complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components

Why ?

- Created and replicated quickly and at scale.
- Alleviates strain on a design resources to focus on larger, more complex problems
- It creates a unified language within and between crossfunctional teams.
- Creates consistency across products, channels and potentially siloed departments.
- Can serve as an educational tool and reference for junior-level designers and content contributors.

- REACT JS, Chakra UI, OneFishDesign (internal eFishery library)

## Components

Usually eFishery uses OneFishDesign but if something is not there, we can create our own components by using Chakra UI
